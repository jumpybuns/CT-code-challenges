# CT-code-challenges

Basics - this looks pretty straightforward, if you have obvious repetition then you can simplify by condensing the repeated var to 1 var

Computed Props - yeah i guess this is also a way of condensing, this time its packing a longer line of code into the same sentence. I guess it seems like shorthand or combining sentences to make a shorthand run on sentence. 

Creation - using typeof where you wnat in insert a var instead of the const iteself

Statics - instanceof to call a previous class into a new object

Extends - using instanceof in booleans

Array Destructuring - this is to make code shorter and skipping a lot of var declaration

String Destructuring - similar but with strings and missing characters are undefined

Object Destructuring - objects can be torn apart and refactored in the assert equal line

Destructuring with Defaults - you can provide default values for a missing value if its undefined.

Destructuring function params - you can destructure params from objects, multiple arrays and objects, or for a missing array value

Destructuring with Alias - 
use a colon  after the prop name and assign a new name. for function param names use colon behind it

Rests as Params - ...rest must be the last param. can be used to get all the other params. 

Rests while Destructuring - ...all is used the same way but actually i have no idea whats going on here

Array Spread - expands items of array by prefixing it with "..."
its opposite of the rest syntax. used with function params as well

Function Defaults - make params more flexible, it is used when undefined is passed. its evaluated at run time. it can also be used as function
